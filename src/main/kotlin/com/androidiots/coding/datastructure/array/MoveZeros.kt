/*
  We will keep read and write markers and point them to the end of the array. Letâ€™s take an overview of the algorithm:

While moving the read pointer towards the start of the array:

If the value at the read pointer is 0, decrement the read pointer.
If the value at the read pointer is non-zero, set the value at the write pointer equal to the value at the read pointer, and decrement the write and read pointers.
Once, the read pointer reaches the 0^{th}
0
th

 index, start assigning zeros to all the values from the write pointer back to the 0^{th}
0
th

 index.
